#Project-1: SMU - Student Performance Analysis
The first step in this assignment was to identify a dataset of interest for our group, which ended up taking us longer than expected. Our professor encouraged us to explore multiple datasets, and after much deliberation, we collectively chose a dataset focused on Student Performance Factors, which we found on Kaggle.

Once we had our dataset, our group formulated four research questions that we aimed to answer based on the data:

1. What patterns or relationships can be identified between specific factors and exam scores (or score differences) across different quartiles of exam performance?
2. Does the gender ratio correlate with the proportion of students earning an 'A' grade, or is one gender more successful than the other despite the ratio?
3. Is there a correlation between the number of hours of sleep per night and student attendance?
4. How does parental involvement impact the general motivation level of students?

To tackle these questions, we assigned each question to an individual group member to investigate, with each person working in their respective branch. Additionally, we decided to collaborate on one question together, ensuring collective input and discussion.

In addition to analyzing the data, we also divided responsibilities for other aspects of the project to maintain consistency and quality:

- Visualization Code
- Data Collection
- PowerPoint Presentation

While each group member is responsible for their specific question and tasks, we also review and double-check each other's work to ensure that everything flows together smoothly and is consistent across the project.
